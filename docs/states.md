# states - Allele-specific methylation file format

## Synopsis
```shell
$ dnmtools states [OPTIONS] <input.sam>
```

## Description

All programs that calculate statistics related to ASM must take read
distribution into account. We defined an intermediate format, `epiread`,
to encapsulate read information in a more efficient manner.

Epiread format consists of three columns. The first column is the
chromosome of the read, the second is the numbering order of the first
CpG in the read, and the last is the CpG-only sequence of the read,
leading to a large decrease in size and complexity. The program
`methstates` has been provided to convert mapped read files using the
SAM format generated by format reads as input. An example is shown
below:

```shell
$ dnmtools states -c /path/to/genome.fa -o output.epiread input.sam
```

## Options

```txt
 -o, -output
```
output file name
```txt
 -c, -chrom
```
FASTA file or directory of chromosomes containing FASTA files [required]

```txt
 -v, -verbose
```
print more run info to STDERR while the program is running.
